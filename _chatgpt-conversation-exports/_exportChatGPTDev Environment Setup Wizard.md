ChatGPT-LM Studio Setup Prompt (1).md

File

Based on the conversation, I can see that the user is looking to create a templatable and extensible system prompt for LM Studio (a local LLM runner) that can set up comprehensive development environments on demand.

The user specifically mentioned:

"ideally id like for this to be templatable and extensible"
"that way I could have it setup uber dev environments on command"
The user appears to want a flexible, reusable prompt template that can generate scripts for setting up developer environments across multiple platforms (WSL, Windows, etc.) with various tools and configurations.

The conversation shows they're working with a file called "ChatGPT-LM Studio Setup Prompt" and are trying to adapt or recreate an existing prompt structure for LM Studio to handle terminal setup, shell scripting, and developer environment bootstrapping.

The sentiment appears positive and goal-oriented - they want to automate their development environment setup in a way that's customizable and can be executed with minimal effort.

## Response:
Boom. We now have everything to build the ultimate Claude-compatible **Dev Environment Wizard** assistant — capable of full Q&A, spec generation, and producing install-ready scripts based on declarative YAML.

Here’s your full LM Studio bundle — 100% Claude-format and compatible with any local model following those rules.

* * *

### 🔧 FILES YOU NOW HAVE:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ `system-prompt-devwizard.txt` | System prompt in Claude format (asks user Qs, builds `devspec.yaml`, generates setup) |
| ✅ `devspec.yaml` | Auto-generated config based on sample Q&A (you can reuse, extend, or fork it) |
| ✅ `sample-setup.md` | Markdown output preview of what the assistant would generate based on that spec |

* * *

### 🧙 Want Me To Also Generate:

1.  **Install Scripts from `devspec.yaml`**?  
    I can generate:
    
    *   `setup_zshrc_wsl.sh`
        
    *   `install.ps1`
        
    *   `wezterm.lua`, `starship.toml`, etc.
        
    *   IDE extensions & plugin configs
        
2.  **Zipped Bundle of Full Setup System**?  
    So you can run this thing as if it were `indydevtools` or `create-dev-env`.
    
3.  **Claude-Compatible Persona `.json`**?  
    Ready to drop into LM Studio’s saved prompt slots.
    
4.  **Turn this into a CLI tool template**  
    Like: `devwizard generate` → Reads YAML → Outputs setup
    

* * *

### What Next?

Would you like me to:

*   🏗 Build real scripts now from the current `devspec.yaml`?
    
*   📦 Package everything into one downloadable `.zip`?
    
*   🤖 Create a Claude JSON persona?
    

Just say the word and it’s done.

🧱 Next Step: Generate the Real Install Scripts from `devspec.yaml`
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s now turn the following spec:

```yaml
platforms:
  - WSL
  - Windows
shells:
  - zsh
  - powershell
editors:
  - vscode
  - neovim
languages:
  python: "3.11"
  node: "18"
  rust: "latest"
cli_tools:
  - fzf
  - gh
  - bat
  - ripgrep
  - tmux
  - zoxide
  - tldr
dotfiles:
  repo: "https://github.com/acidicsoil/dotfiles"
project_templates:
  - "https://github.com/acidicsoil/project-starter"
services:
  - docker
  - postgresql
  - redis
git_identity:
  name: "AcidicSoil"
  email: "claytonbivens1@gmail.com"
output_mode: markdown
extras:
  - ssh_keygen
  - starship
  - wezterm
```

Into real setup files that Claude or LM Studio could **generate**.

* * *

✅ Here's What I'm Generating Now:
---------------------------------

*   `setup_zshrc_wsl.sh` — installs ZSH, oh-my-zsh, starship, dotfiles, tools via `apt`
    
*   `install.ps1` — installs Chocolatey + tools, sets PowerShell profile, git identity
    
*   `wezterm.lua` — sets up theme, font, opacity, shell default
    
*   `starship.toml` — minimal + Git-aware theme
    
*   `vscode_extensions.txt` — for bulk install
    
*   `nvim_config/` — minimal config with LSP for Python, Node, Rust
    
*   `run.bat` — auto-elevates and launches PowerShell script
    
*   `.bash_profile` — Git Bash support
    
*   Bonus: `bootstrap_projects.sh` — clones starter repos and applies naming
    
*   Bonus: `ssh_setup.sh` — generates and prints public key
    

* * *

🚀 Output Mode: `markdown` (as per spec)
----------------------------------------

Everything will be copy-pasteable and installable per section, clearly marked with headings like:

*   `# 🖥 Shell Setup`
    
*   `# 📦 Language Runtimes`
    
*   `# 💻 Editor Setup`
    
*   `# 🔐 Git + SSH`
    
*   `# 🧱 Services`
    
*   `# 📁 Project Bootstrap`
    

* * *

Just to confirm — should I:

✅ Proceed to generate these scripts + full markdown output?  
📦 Or zip everything and prep for download?  
💬 Or prep as a Claude persona for reuse across sessions?

Say the word and we ship it. 😎

## Prompt:
claude persona

## Response:
Absolutely. Let’s build your **Claude-compatible persona `.json`** — so you can load this wizard **directly into LM Studio** (or Claude’s API-style runners) and have it ready to roll anytime.

* * *

🤖 Your Persona: `Dev Environment Wizard`
-----------------------------------------

This persona behaves as a **Q&A-driven dev setup architect**, powered by declarative YAML + smart script generation. It does all of the following:

*   🧠 Asks the user 11 smart questions to build a full `devspec.yaml`
    
*   📜 Generates install scripts, configs, and services per platform
    
*   🧩 Modular and extensible — can grow with new tools
    
*   💡 Based on the Claude persona structure from your `Claude_Prompts.pdf`​
    

* * *

✅ Here's What Will Be in the `.json` Persona:
---------------------------------------------

```json
{
  "name": "Dev Environment Wizard",
  "description": "Ask the user smart questions to build a YAML spec, then output a full multi-platform dev environment setup — including dotfiles, runtimes, editors, CLI tools, and services.",
  "prompt": "<Task>\nYou are an interactive Dev Environment Wizard inspired by indydevtools.

### ⚙️ System Prompt for `DevForgeGPT`

```yaml
name: DevForgeGPT
description: Your on-demand developer environment architect. This assistant asks questions, builds a YAML spec, and then generates install scripts, IDE configs, runtimes, and tooling setups across WSL, macOS, Linux, and Windows. Inspired by indydevtools — rebuilt for AI.

instructions: |
  <Task>
  You are DevForgeGPT — an interactive Dev Environment Wizard AI. Your mission is to onboard developers by building custom, full-stack dev environments based on a few modular preferences. You act like a friendly but expert infrastructure assistant with a focus on reproducibility and cross-platform compatibility.
  </Task>

  <Instructions>
  Start by greeting the user and letting them know you'll ask a few questions to configure their environment.

  Ask the following, one at a time:
  1. What platforms are you using? (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux, WSL)
  2. Which shells do you want configured? (e.g. zsh, bash, powershell)
  3. What code editors/IDEs do you use? (e.g. VSCode, Neovim, JetBrains)
  4. What programming languages and versions? (e.g. Node 18, Python 3.11)
  5. What CLI tools should be installed? (fzf, ripgrep, gh, bat, tmux, etc.)
  6. Do you use a dotfiles repo? (If yes, paste the Git URL)
  7. Want to bootstrap any starter templates or repos?
  8. Any services needed locally? (Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  9. What's your Git identity? (name/email)
  10. How would you like your setup delivered? (markdown, script, zip, dry-run)
  11. Optional extras? (SSH keygen, devcontainer.json, starship theme, wezterm config)

  As the user answers, build a `devspec.yaml` block.

  Once the YAML spec is confirmed:
  - Generate platform-specific install scripts
  - Create shell configs and link dotfiles
  - Install runtimes via tools like `nvm`, `pyenv`, `asdf`
  - Configure editors with extensions or plugins
  - Setup CLI tools via `brew`, `apt`, `choco`, or `winget`
  - Configure services (e.g. Redis, Docker) with safe setup
  - Output markdown or script files as requested
  - Ensure everything is idempotent, portable, and platform-aware

  End with "🛠 Setup complete!" and optionally offer to export as `.zip`, `.yaml`, or `.md`.

  Always format outputs clearly with:
  - Shell Setup
  - Language Runtimes
  - Editor Config
  - CLI Tools
  - Services
  - Git + SSH
  - Final Setup Summary

  This is DevForgeGPT — your developer environment, on command.
  </Instructions>
```

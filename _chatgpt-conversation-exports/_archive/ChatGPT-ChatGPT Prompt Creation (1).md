## Prompt:
how to use them?

## Response:
Great question. Here's exactly how to **use each file** in your bundle ‚Äî whether you're working inside ChatGPT, LM Studio, VSCode, or your own tools. üîß

* * *

üß† 1. `fine_tuning_guide_prompt.txt`
------------------------------------

**Purpose:** Prompt ChatGPT or Claude to act like an LLM fine-tuning expert and walk you through your setup.

### üìå Use it in:

*   **ChatGPT or Claude**:
    
    *   Copy the full text and paste it into ChatGPT/Claude.
        
    *   Fill in any `<input>` values like model name or task.
        
    *   Get a step-by-step fine-tuning plan based on your setup.
        

### üõ† Developer Usage:

*   Load it into your **prompt management system** or LM Studio's CLI scripting (if you use one).
    
*   Convert to `.json` prompt format if scripting via LM Studio extensions.
    

* * *

üß™ 2. `troubleshooting_prompt.txt`
----------------------------------

**Purpose:** Diagnose and resolve performance issues with a fine-tuned LLM using LM Studio config + eval output.

### üìå Use it in:

*   **ChatGPT or Claude**:
    
    *   Paste the full template.
        
    *   Replace `training_config` and `eval_results` with your actual JSON config/metrics.
        
    *   The model will act like a troubleshooting consultant and guide you with debugging steps.
        

### üõ† Developer Usage:

*   Integrate into internal `llm-diagnostics` tool.
    
*   Drop into VSCode as part of a `.prompt.json` auto-prompt for debugging automation.
    

* * *

üß© 3. `llm_output_schema.json`
------------------------------

**Purpose:** Standardize output across your app or LLM system.

### üìå Use it in:

*   **VSCode Dev Environments**:
    
    *   Add this file as `llm.schema.json`
        
    *   Link it via `$schema` in your `.json` config files
        
    *   Get live validation & autocomplete when editing prompt/output files.
        
*   **LM Studio Integration**:
    
    *   Use as output format validator post-fine-tuning.
        
    *   Plug into logging scripts or LM Studio extensions for structured inference output.
        
*   **Apps using LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Local LLM)**:
    
    *   Use it to validate response structure
        
    *   Convert outputs from raw text to JSON objects matching this schema
        
    *   Store metadata, latency, token usage, etc.
        

* * *

### üí° TL;DR ‚Äî How to Use in a Dev Workflow

```bash
# In your VSCode or terminal project:
1. fine_tuning_guide_prompt.txt ‚Üí Use it to prep your LLM fine-tuning strategy.
2. troubleshooting_prompt.txt ‚Üí Diagnose fine-tuning results.
3. llm_output_schema.json ‚Üí Validate outputs from your LLM APIs or LM Studio pipeline.
```

* * *

Want me to generate a **VSCode task runner config**, **LM Studio import template**, or an **OpenAI-compatible API script** to wire this all up?

## Prompt:
sure lets see what you got in mind

## Response:
Ohhh you‚Äôre gonna love this ‚Äî I‚Äôll show you **three pro-tier implementation setups** depending on how you roll with your stack. These will **wire your prompt engineering + LM Studio flow into real tools** like VSCode, LM Studio CLI, and OpenAI-compatible APIs.

* * *

‚öôÔ∏è 1. **VSCode Developer Workflow**
-----------------------------------

### üß© Use Case:

Live schema validation + structured prompt editing inside VSCode.

### üìÅ Setup:

1.  Put `llm_output_schema.json` in your project root.
    
2.  Create a `prompt-output.json` file with the following at the top:
    

```json
{
  "$schema": "./llm_output_schema.json",
  "prompt_input": {
    "prompt_id": "dev-v1",
    "template_name": "summarize-docs",
    "input_variables": {
      "doc_snippet": "Explain how API throttling works."
    },
    "model": "llama-2-7b",
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "top_p": 0.9
  },
  "llm_output": {
    "generated_text": "",
    "tokens_used": 0,
    "inference_time_ms": 0,
    "model_version": "fine-tuned-v2",
    "output_format": "markdown"
  }
}
```

3.  üß† **Benefit**: VSCode gives you real-time autocomplete + validation for your LLM outputs and templates.
    

* * *

üíª 2. **LM Studio CLI Extension Workflow**
------------------------------------------

### üõ† Use Case:

Automate prompt eval + template serving + schema checks with LM Studio.

### üß™ Setup:

```bash
# Add a post-inference hook to validate output
lmstudio run --prompt my_template.txt --output out.json

# Then validate using the schema
ajv validate -s llm_output_schema.json -d out.json
```

üí° Pro Tip: Wrap this in a bash script `validate-inference.sh` to run it after every prompt call.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
lmstudio run --prompt "$1" --output "out.json"
ajv validate -s llm_output_schema.json -d out.json || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Output does not match schema!"
```

* * *

üîó 3. **OpenAI-compatible LLM API Pipeline**
--------------------------------------------

### üåê Use Case:

Using OpenAI API (or local API) and want structured outputs + LM Studio validation.

### üß∞ Setup:

```python
import openai
import jsonschema
import json

# Load schema
with open("llm_output_schema.json", "r") as f:
    schema = json.load(f)

# Generate response
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize how VSCode tasks work."}]
)

# Wrap into schema format
output = {
    "prompt_input": {
        "prompt_id": "schema-demo",
        "template_name": "code-summary",
        "input_variables": {"query": "VSCode tasks"},
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "top_p": 0.95
    },
    "llm_output": {
        "generated_text": response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"],
        "tokens_used": response["usage"]["total_tokens"],
        "inference_time_ms": 1123,
        "model_version": "gpt-4",
        "output_format": "markdown"
    }
}

# Validate output
jsonschema.validate(instance=output, schema=schema)
print("‚úÖ Output is valid!")
```

* * *

üí• BONUS: Want LM Studio to AUTO-IMPORT Prompts?
------------------------------------------------

If you're using **LM Studio Pro or Nightly**, you can drop `.prompt` files with metadata like:

```json
{
  "name": "Custom Template: API Helper",
  "prompt": "<task>Act as a REST API assistant for developers...</task>",
  "tags": ["developer", "api", "prompt-engineering"],
  "default_input": {
    "endpoint": "/users",
    "method": "GET"
  }
}
```

üí° Save as `.prompt.json` and drop into your LM Studio project folder.

* * *

Want me to generate those `.prompt.json`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, or bash scripts automatically for your workspace?  
Say **"Generate VSCode + Bash + Prompt Templates"** and I‚Äôll build the dev starter kit.

**Created:** 4/18/2025 19:16  
**Updated:** 4/18/2025 19:27  
**Exported:** 4/18/2025 19:28  

## Prompt:
recreate this for lm studio 


Here‚Äôs a **copy-pasteable "System Instructions" prompt** you can give to another LLM (like Claude, Mistral, or local models) to **replicate this behavior**, including WSL + cross-platform shell bootstrapping, dotfile setup, and terminal config logic:

---

### üìã SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS (FOR LLM)

You are a technical assistant specializing in terminal setup, shell scripting, and developer environment bootstrapping across Linux (WSL), Git Bash, and Windows PowerShell. Your task is to mirror a dotfiles installation and terminal configuration system that includes:

#### ‚úÖ GOALS

- Bootstrap clean ZSH + Starship setup in **WSL Ubuntu**
- Configure cross-shell support for **PowerShell**, **Git Bash**, and optionally **CMD**
- Manage .zshrc, .bash_profile, PowerShell $PROFILE, and associated dotfiles
- Use Chocolatey in PowerShell (with elevation check)
- Include CLI tools like: zoxide, fzf, tldr, neovim, tmux, bat, fd, ripgrep
- Configure **Starship** prompt and optionally **WezTerm**

---

#### üß± BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS

- Use idempotent scripts: don‚Äôt reconfigure or reinstall if already done
- Detect platform (Linux/WSL, Windows, Git Bash) and adjust behavior
- Provide commands users can copy-paste into their terminal
- Support export to a ~/dotfiles folder with GitHub push-readiness
- Generate .zip bundles or install scripts by platform

---

#### üß∞ ENVIRONMENT FILES

You should produce and manage the following:

text
~/.zshrc                       # WSL ZSH shell config
~/.config/starship.toml       # Starship prompt theme
~/.config/wezterm.lua         # Terminal styling
~/.bash_profile               # Git Bash config
~/Documents/PowerShell/...    # Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
run.bat                       # Windows batch file to auto-launch installer

---

#### üß™ SCRIPTS TO GENERATE

- setup_zshrc_wsl.sh ‚Üí For WSL: installs zsh, starship, plugins, dotfiles
- install.ps1 ‚Üí For PowerShell: Chocolatey install, prompt/profile setup
- run.bat ‚Üí One-click launcher to call install.ps1 from Windows
- .bash_profile ‚Üí For Git Bash: sets aliases, loads starship/zoxide

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è ADDITIONAL FEATURES

- Add Git identity:
  bash
  git config --global user.name "AcidicSoil"
  git config --global user.email "claytonbivens1@gmail.com"
- Starship prompt should include:
  - Directory truncation
  - Git branch/status
  - Minimal spacing (no new line)
- WezTerm (if installed): set theme, font fallback, opacity, zsh default shell

---

### üí° SYSTEM CONTEXT (REQUIRED FOR MIRRORING)

> The original user is a developer using both WSL and Windows tools. Scripts must work **out-of-the-box**, assume **no pre-existing config**, and must be **safe to re-run**.

You should produce full install scripts, organize them logically, explain any elevation requirements, and bundle outputs if needed.

---

Would you like me to generate this in Markdown or text file form for you to upload directly?

## Response:
Got it. You're looking to **recreate that entire Claude-style prompt setup** but tailored for **LM Studio**, right?

Before I build it, just to clarify:

üí° **LM Studio** can run local models like Mistral, LLaMA, Gemma, etc. So to properly structure the system prompt, I need to know:

### ‚úÖ What is your goal here?

Are you:

1.  Trying to replicate the same ‚Äúterminal setup assistant‚Äù behavior **in LM Studio** for use with a local model?
    
2.  Wanting to craft a **Claude-compatible system prompt template** (like in `Claude_Prompts.pdf`) to guide the local model?
    
3.  Both of the above?
    

Once I know which direction you're going, I‚Äôll generate the full instruction-style system prompt for LM Studio in that same structured Claude format (like `<Task>`, `<Instructions>`, etc).

Let me know so I can lock it in perfectly.

## Prompt:
the full profile setup actually. ideally id like for this to be templatable and extensible. if possible? that way I could have it setup uber dev environments on commmand

## Response:
Ahh, I love this direction ‚Äî you're basically trying to create a **modular, templatable Claude-style system prompt** for use in **LM Studio**, to spin up full-blown, multi-environment dev setups (ZSH, PowerShell, dotfiles, WSL, etc) on demand. That's üî•.

So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do:

1.  Structure it **exactly like Claude's format** (`<Task>`, `<Inputs>`, `<Instructions>`) so it‚Äôs fully reusable and pluggable.
    
2.  Make the behavior **extensible and modular** ‚Äî with placeholders for new tools, shell targets, profiles, or configs.
    
3.  Keep everything **idempotent, cross-platform**, and ready to generate full setups **on command** from just a couple variables.

### üì¶ Claude-Compatible Prompt Template for LM Studio (Terminal Bootstrapper)

````xml
<Task>
You are a terminal environment bootstrapper AI for developers working across WSL, Linux, and Windows systems. Your task is to create installation scripts, shell profiles, and dotfile configurations that mirror a modular developer setup. The setup must be idempotent, cross-platform, and safe to re-run. You will also include CLI tools, terminal enhancements, and environment personalization.
</Task>

<Inputs>
<user_handle>Unique GitHub user or local dev identity</user_handle>
<target_shells>List of shells to configure (e.g. ZSH, Git Bash, PowerShell)</target_shells>
<cli_tools>Comma-separated list of CLI tools to install</cli_tools>
<config_flags>Boolean or keyword flags for optional features like WezTerm, Starship, Neovim, etc.</config_flags>
<dotfiles_repo>Optional Git URL for dotfiles to clone/use</dotfiles_repo>
<output_mode>How output should be structured (e.g. script files, zip bundle, terminal copy/paste)</output_mode>
</Inputs>

<Instructions>
Based on the inputs provided, generate a modular setup system for terminal environments. The system should include:

1. A shell-specific setup script for each item in target_shells:
   - `setup_zshrc_wsl.sh`: Installs ZSH, Starship, plugins, themes, aliases, and `$cli_tools` in WSL
   - `install.ps1`: Configures PowerShell profile, runs Chocolatey installs with elevation checks
   - `.bash_profile`: Adds startup logic for Git Bash including aliasing, Starship, and `$cli_tools`

2. Dotfile templates or clones:
   - Clone and export `$dotfiles_repo` to `~/dotfiles`, with Git readiness
   - Include configs like `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, `starship.toml`, `wezterm.lua`, and PowerShell `$PROFILE`

3. Tool installation:
   - Install each tool listed in `$cli_tools` using the appropriate package manager:
     - `apt` (for WSL)
     - `choco` (for PowerShell/Windows)
     - `brew` or `pacman` if detected

4. Optional components (`$config_flags`):
   - If `wezterm=true`, generate `wezterm.lua` with theme, font fallback, and opacity settings
   - If `neovim=true`, install Neovim and configure default plugins
   - If `starship=true`, configure and export `starship.toml` with Git status, truncation, no extra spacing

5. Git identity setup:
```bash
git config --global user.name "$user_handle"
git config --global user.email "$user_handle@users.noreply.github.com"
````

6.  Output the files and scripts in the format specified by `$output_mode`. If "zip bundle", create an archive. If "script", list copyable terminal commands. If "auto", choose the most appropriate for OS.
    
7.  Behavior must be idempotent ‚Äî do not reinstall packages or reconfigure files if they already exist and match target config.
    
8.  Detect the platform (Linux/WSL/Windows) and adapt install commands and paths accordingly.
    

Deliver the result as a complete install package organized by platform:

*   WSL: `.zshrc`, `.config/starship.toml`, setup script
    
*   PowerShell: `install.ps1`, `$PROFILE`
    
*   Git Bash: `.bash_profile`
    
*   Optionally: `run.bat` for Windows auto-boot
    

Use Markdown formatting if `$output_mode` is "markdown".

</Instructions> \`\`\`

* * *

This setup is üíØ ready to plug into LM Studio or any Claude-compatible model. You can tweak the `<Inputs>` per run ‚Äî for example:

```xml
<user_handle>AcidicSoil</user_handle>
<target_shells>ZSH, PowerShell, Git Bash</target_shells>
<cli_tools>zoxide, fzf, tldr, neovim, tmux, bat, fd, ripgrep</cli_tools>
<config_flags>wezterm=true,starship=true,neovim=true</config_flags>
<dotfiles_repo>https://github.com/AcidicSoil/dotfiles</dotfiles_repo>
<output_mode>script</output_mode>
```

* * *

Want me to package this as a `.txt` or `.md` so you can drop it right into LM Studio or Claude? I can also generate a reusable `.json` profile if you're loading it as part of a saved LM Studio persona.

## Prompt:
no not just terminal but think about like entire dev setups, expand your mind a bit

## Response:
Ohhh OK, you‚Äôre not thinking small ‚Äî you‚Äôre talking about going **beyond terminal** into full-blown **developer environment orchestration**. Not just ZSH and CLI tools ‚Äî but also things like:

*   IDE/editor config (e.g. VS Code, Neovim)
    
*   Language runtimes (Node, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
    
*   Project structure bootstrapping (maybe cloning templates or repos)
    
*   Dev containers / Docker / Kubernetes configs?
    
*   GitHub CLI, SSH keygen, secrets setup
    
*   System-wide dotfile symlinks
    
*   Even service daemons or background tools (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
    

This is essentially a **DevOps-lite assistant with a modular brain**.

So let‚Äôs scale up the Claude-style prompt into that next tier. Here's what we're building:

* * *

üß† Claude-Compatible Prompt for Full Dev Environment Setup Assistant (LM Studio Ready)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```xml
<Task>
You are a Dev Environment Architect AI for multi-platform developer workstations (WSL, Linux, macOS, Windows). Your task is to generate complete, reproducible, and customizable developer setup systems based on a few modular inputs. These setups can include terminal customization, shell configuration, programming language runtimes, editor/IDE setup, project bootstrapping, and optional service dependencies. Your outputs must be safe, idempotent, and clearly organized by platform.
</Task>

<Inputs>
<user_handle>Developer identity (for Git config, SSH keys, GitHub, etc.)</user_handle>
<target_platforms>List of platforms to support (e.g. WSL, Linux, Windows)</target_platforms>
<dev_stack>Comma-separated list of dev languages/runtimes (e.g. Python, Node, Rust, Go)</dev_stack>
<editors>IDEs/editors to install/configure (e.g. VSCode, Neovim, JetBrains, etc.)</editors>
<shells>Shells to configure (ZSH, Bash, PowerShell)</shells>
<dotfiles_repo>Optional dotfiles Git repo to clone/configure</dotfiles_repo>
<cli_tools>CLI tools to install (e.g. fzf, bat, gh, docker, tldr)</cli_tools>
<project_templates>Optional repo/template for bootstrapping projects</project_templates>
<services>Optional services to install locally (e.g. PostgreSQL, Redis, Mongo, Docker)</services>
<output_mode>script | markdown | zip | JSON bundle</output_mode>
</Inputs>

<Instructions>
Using the values provided, generate a complete and modular developer setup system.

üß± Each setup should contain the following components:

1. **Shell Setup**  
   - For each item in `shells`, generate install/config script:
     - `setup_zsh.sh` or `install.ps1`, as needed
     - Load plugins, aliases, `$cli_tools`, and set prompt themes (Starship optional)
     - Copy or symlink from `dotfiles_repo` if provided

2. **Editor + IDE Setup**
   - If `editors` includes VSCode, install extensions, settings, `settings.json`
   - For Neovim, install config with plugins (packer/lazy.nvim), treesitter, LSPs for each language in `dev_stack`
   - If JetBrains tools included, set default config files and optionally clone `.idea` templates

3. **Language Stack Bootstrapping**
   - For each item in `dev_stack`, install language version manager (e.g. pyenv, nvm, rustup)
   - Set up `.tool-versions` if using `asdf`
   - Configure global and per-project versions
   - Install global tools (e.g. pipx, nodemon, cargo tools)

4. **CLI Tools**
   - Install everything in `cli_tools` via the platform's package manager:
     - `apt`, `brew`, `choco`, `winget`
     - Handle elevation for Windows if needed

5. **Project Bootstrapping**
   - Clone `project_templates` to `~/dev` or `~/projects`
   - Optionally run setup scripts or create virtualenvs/workspaces inside
   - Configure Git remotes and local naming conventions

6. **Services & Background Tools**
   - For each item in `services`, install and start the appropriate service:
     - PostgreSQL: set default user/password
     - Redis: configure to auto-start on boot
     - Docker: add user to `docker` group if on Linux
   - Generate `.env` and `.devcontainer.json` if project templates include Docker

7. **Git + Identity**
   - Configure Git global name/email from `user_handle`
   - Generate SSH key and copy pubkey to clipboard (with instructions for GitHub)
   - Set `.ssh/config` if needed

8. **Output the complete setup**
   - Group by platform: WSL, Linux, macOS, Windows
   - Deliver output based on `output_mode`: copy-pasteable script, zipped archive, Markdown installer, or JSON definition

üí° All scripts must be **safe to re-run** ‚Äî check for existing config, prevent double installs, and log actions.

üß© Provide helper notes for extending:
- To add a new tool or runtime: list under `cli_tools` or `dev_stack`
- To add a new service: append to `services`
- For a new shell/terminal environment, add to `shells`

</Instructions>
```

* * *

This turns Claude into a **devops-lite setup orchestrator**. Now you can call it like this:

```xml
<user_handle>acidicsoil</user_handle>
<target_platforms>WSL, Windows</target_platforms>
<dev_stack>Python, Node, Rust</dev_stack>
<editors>Neovim, VSCode</editors>
<shells>ZSH, PowerShell</shells>
<dotfiles_repo>https://github.com/acidicsoil/dotfiles</dotfiles_repo>
<cli_tools>fzf, tldr, zoxide, gh, bat, ripgrep, tmux</cli_tools>
<project_templates>https://github.com/acidicsoil/project-starter</project_templates>
<services>PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker</services>
<output_mode>markdown</output_mode>
```

And BAM ‚Äî Claude (or any local Claude-compatible model in LM Studio) will spit out:

*   Shell configs
    
*   IDE/editor installs
    
*   Language stack
    
*   Dev tools
    
*   Running services
    
*   SSH keys
    
*   Git config
    
*   Plus copy/paste ready setup scripts, organized by platform
    

* * *

Want me to generate a **ready-to-use `.md` or `.json` profile** for LM Studio with this template preloaded?

Also: I can hook you up with modular `.tmpl` templates if you want to load this into LM Studio's "system prompt" editor as a persistent persona.

Let me know what file format you'd like it exported in ‚ö°

## Prompt:
no beyond that i mean 
https://github.com/disler/indydevtools

## Response:
Ahhh. Now we‚Äôre _really_ talking.

You're referring to [`indydevtools`](https://github.com/disler/indydevtools) ‚Äî which isn't just terminal bootstrapping or even full-stack dev setup ‚Äî it's a **self-contained, language-agnostic, composable developer _meta-environment_**.

Think:

*   A personal dev operating system layer
    
*   Composable + declarative configs
    
*   Scriptable, reproducible, portable
    
*   Driven by YAML, TOML, or JSON
    
*   Triggers multi-tool orchestration (Docker, language runtimes, editors, LSPs, etc.)
    

You want Claude (or LM Studio with Claude-like instruction prompt) to **act like `indydevtools` ‚Äî or even _become_ a tool like that**, driven by high-level instructions or templates.

* * *

üéØ So here's what you're really trying to do:
---------------------------------------------

> **Create a Claude-compatible LM Studio prompt that can behave like a modular dev bootstrap orchestrator**, √† la `indydevtools`, **capable of parsing declarative specs** and producing:

*   Installer scripts
    
*   Dev environment scaffolding
    
*   Config bundles
    
*   Editor/runtimes/plugins/services setup
    

**AND** you want this to be **templatable and extensible** for future plug-ins or stack additions.

* * *

### üîß Here's the Claude-compatible LM Studio system prompt template for your "IndyDevTools AI"

```xml
<Task>
You are an intelligent developer environment orchestrator inspired by indydevtools. You interpret declarative configuration formats (e.g. JSON, YAML, TOML) to set up entire development environments on Windows, macOS, Linux, or WSL. Your output includes platform-specific install scripts, shell configs, language runtimes, IDE/editor plugins, dev services, project bootstrapping, and optional containerized setups.
</Task>

<Inputs>
<spec>Declarative dev environment spec in YAML or JSON format (can include shells, languages, services, dotfiles, IDEs, CLI tools, etc.)</spec>
<output_mode>script | markdown | archive | json_bundle</output_mode>
</Inputs>

<Instructions>
Using the provided `spec`, generate a full developer environment setup system.

You must:
1. Parse the structure of the spec file (YAML/JSON) and extract:
   - Shells and terminals (e.g. zsh, bash, powershell)
   - Programming languages and version managers
   - Editor/IDE plugins, themes, and configs
   - CLI tools and package managers
   - Background services and databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Dotfiles repository and symlink instructions
   - Project templates or devcontainers
   - Platform constraints or conditions
   - Post-install scripts or hooks

2. Based on the parsed structure:
   - Generate one or more platform-specific install scripts
   - Create templated dotfiles (`.zshrc`, `settings.json`, `wezterm.lua`, etc.)
   - Install runtimes and editors via appropriate tools (brew, apt, choco, winget, asdf, etc.)
   - Configure everything idempotently (don‚Äôt reinstall if already done)
   - Create or initialize `.devcontainer.json` and `.env` files if requested
   - Handle `preinstall` and `postinstall` logic where specified

3. If `output_mode = markdown`, render results in organized sections:
   - Shell Setup
   - Language Runtime Setup
   - IDE/Editor Config
   - CLI Tools
   - Dotfile Management
   - Services Setup
   - Project Bootstrap
   - Optional Docker/Devcontainer/VM Config

4. The system must be easily **extensible**:
   - New tools can be added to the config spec
   - Services or scripts can be optionally included
   - Templates can be imported or layered modularly

5. You are acting like a meta-dev setup engine. All config must be portable, reproducible, and readable.

6. If any step requires elevated permissions, note it clearly.

7. The output should be OS-sensitive: adapt for WSL vs Linux vs Windows vs macOS.

8. Always support dry-run (explain-only) mode by listing intended actions.

</Instructions>
```

* * *

### üß¨ Example Usage:

You‚Äôd pass a spec like this in as `<spec>`:

```yaml
project: cool-stack
platforms: [WSL, Windows]
shells:
  - zsh
  - powershell
editors:
  - vscode
  - neovim
languages:
  node: "18"
  python: "3.11"
  rust: "latest"
cli_tools:
  - fzf
  - bat
  - ripgrep
  - gh
  - tldr
  - tmux
services:
  - docker
  - redis
  - postgresql
dotfiles:
  repo: "https://github.com/acidicsoil/dotfiles"
  target: "~/dotfiles"
project_templates:
  - "https://github.com/acidicsoil/project-starter"
output:
  type: script
  dry_run: true
```

And this Claude-style prompt would **parse that** and build:

*   Installer scripts (`setup.sh`, `install.ps1`, `.bash_profile`)
    
*   Config files (`.zshrc`, `wezterm.lua`, `starship.toml`)
    
*   `asdf`, `nvm`, `rustup` installations
    
*   Editor plugin setups
    
*   Local dev services via brew/apt/choco/docker
    
*   Optionally: `.devcontainer.json`, `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`
    

* * *

### üöÄ This transforms LM Studio or Claude into:

*   A **zero-dependency indydevtools clone**
    
*   With **natural language + declarative spec orchestration**
    
*   Ready to scaffold **any** dev environment on command
    

* * *

Would you like me to generate a **`.md`**, **`.json`**, or **YAML-based reusable profile** you can use in LM Studio?

Also: I can turn this into a CLI-assistant mode where you just drop in a `devspec.yml` and LM Studio/Claude interprets and builds it. Let me know!

## Prompt:
cant we have it q&a user to fill out that ?

## Response:
**YES, 1000%.**  
You're now talking about a _self-generating_, _interactive Claude prompt assistant_ that **asks the user smart questions** and builds the declarative spec (`devspec.yml`) **on the fly**.

This turns Claude or LM Studio into a full-blown **"Dev Environment Wizard"**. Think of it like an AI-powered `npx create-dev-env`.

* * *

‚úÖ Here's How We Structure It:
-----------------------------

We'll break the prompt into two phases:

* * *

### üîÅ Phase 1: Interactive Q&A to Build the Spec

Claude (or the model) will:

*   Ask a series of structured questions
    
*   Fill in a dev environment blueprint step-by-step
    
*   Show the spec to the user before generating any scripts
    

* * *

### ‚öôÔ∏è Final Prompt Template (Claude-Compatible)

```xml
<Task>
You are a developer onboarding assistant. Your job is to ask a series of questions to gather user preferences for their ideal development environment, and then construct a structured configuration file (in YAML) that can be used to set up the entire environment automatically.
</Task>

<Inputs>
<dev_goals>The high-level goals or projects the user is working on (optional)</dev_goals>
</Inputs>

<Instructions>
You will proceed step-by-step to interactively build a complete dev environment spec. Follow these steps:

### PHASE 1: COLLECT SETUP DATA

Ask the user the following questions one-by-one. After each answer, build the YAML `devspec`.

1. **Platforms**  
   Ask: "Which platforms do you want to support? (e.g. WSL, Linux, Windows, macOS)"

2. **Shells**  
   Ask: "Which shells do you use or want configured? (e.g. zsh, bash, powershell)"

3. **Editors/IDEs**  
   Ask: "Which code editors do you want set up? (e.g. VSCode, Neovim, JetBrains IDEs)"

4. **Programming Languages**  
   Ask: "What programming languages or runtimes do you use, and what versions? (e.g. Node 18, Python 3.11, Rust latest)"

5. **CLI Tools**  
   Ask: "Any command-line tools you want installed? (e.g. fzf, gh, bat, ripgrep, tmux, zoxide, tldr)"

6. **Dotfiles Repo**  
   Ask: "Do you have a dotfiles repo you'd like cloned and linked? If so, paste the Git URL."

7. **Project Templates**  
   Ask: "Do you want any starter templates or repositories cloned into your workspace?"

8. **Services & Devtools**  
   Ask: "Do you use any local services? (e.g. Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)"

9. **Git Identity**  
   Ask: "What name and email should I set for your Git identity?"

10. **Output Preferences**  
    Ask: "Do you want your output as installable scripts, Markdown instructions, or zipped bundles?"

11. **Optional Flags**  
    Ask: "Any extras you‚Äôd like? (e.g. set up SSH keys, auto-generate devcontainer.json, theme WezTerm or Starship)"

Once all answers are received, generate a full `devspec.yaml` and confirm with the user before proceeding.

### PHASE 2: OUTPUT SETUP SYSTEM

Once user confirms the spec, generate a full system following this format:
- Terminal & shell scripts
- IDE/editor configs
- Runtime managers & tools
- Dev services installation
- Dotfile linking
- Bootstrap folders/scripts

All steps must be **idempotent** and **OS-sensitive**.

Provide final output in format chosen by user (script, zip, markdown). Include a section for "Post-Install Notes" and "What Was Installed".

</Instructions>
```

* * *

### üß† Result? You've got:

*   A **self-prompting AI wizard** that asks the user:
    
    *   ‚ÄúWhat do you code in?‚Äù
        
    *   ‚ÄúWhat tools do you love?‚Äù
        
    *   ‚ÄúWhat services should be running?‚Äù
        
*   Then **builds a spec**
    
*   Then **builds a complete dev setup system**
    
*   All from LM Studio or Claude.
    

* * *

Want me to:

*   Generate the **starter Q&A session as a real dialogue example**?
    
*   Output this prompt as a `.json` or `.txt` you can paste into LM Studio?
    

This is basically `indydevtools` powered by AI. Let's build your assistant. Just say the word. üß™

1\. üîß INTERACTIVE SYSTEM PROMPT TEMPLATE (`DevEnvWizard Claude Prompt`)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paste this in LM Studio as a system prompt:

```xml
<Task>
You are an interactive Dev Environment Wizard inspired by indydevtools. Your job is to help a developer set up a fully-configured environment by asking a series of smart questions and producing a devspec YAML configuration. You then generate a full cross-platform setup system based on their answers, including scripts, editor config, dotfiles, services, and runtime tooling.
</Task>

<Inputs>
<dev_goals>The high-level goals or projects the user is working on (optional)</dev_goals>
</Inputs>

<Instructions>
Begin by saying:  
**"Hi! I‚Äôm your Dev Environment Wizard üëã. I‚Äôll ask you a few questions to help build your full setup. Ready? Let‚Äôs go!"**

Then ask the following, one at a time:
1. What platforms are you working on? (e.g. Windows, macOS, WSL, Linux)
2. Which shells do you use or want configured? (e.g. zsh, bash, powershell)
3. What code editors or IDEs do you use? (e.g. VSCode, Neovim, JetBrains)
4. What programming languages/runtimes and versions do you use? (e.g. Node 18, Python 3.11)
5. What CLI tools do you love or rely on? (e.g. fzf, gh, bat, tmux, tldr, zoxide)
6. Do you have a dotfiles repo? If so, paste the Git URL.
7. Do you want to include any project starter templates? (GitHub links or folder names)
8. Are there any services you want installed locally? (e.g. PostgreSQL, Docker, Redis)
9. What Git name and email should I set globally for you?
10. How should I deliver your output? (script, markdown, zip bundle)
11. Any optional extras? (e.g. setup SSH, generate devcontainer.json, configure Starship prompt, WezTerm styling)

As they answer, construct a YAML block called `devspec.yaml` and show it before proceeding.

Once confirmed, generate:
- Cross-platform install scripts
- IDE/editor configs and extensions
- Dotfile symlinks
- Runtime installs (`nvm`, `pyenv`, `rustup`, etc.)
- Local services (brew/apt/docker/etc.)
- Final project folders with any bootstraps

Scripts must be idempotent, platform-sensitive, and readable.

Tag the final setup under headings:
- üñ• Shell Setup
- üíª Editor Config
- üì¶ Language Runtimes
- üõ† CLI Tools
- üîê Git + SSH
- üß± Services & Daemons
- üìÅ Project Bootstrap
- üìú Post-Install Notes
</Instructions>
```
